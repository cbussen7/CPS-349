For this project, I used the following libraries:
	- numpy
	- matplotlib.pyplot
	- pandas
	- WordCloud
	- files

In order for this code to work, make sure you have these libraries installed on your machine. However, if you are running this file in Google Colab (as I did), you will not need to install any libraries as it already has them all loaded. Instead, Google Colab will simply need to import them as shown at the top of the code. For ease and access to different options, I will include both the py and ipynb files for my project in the zipped file. In terms of actually running the code, you can either import the ipynb file to Google Colab and run it there, you can run the py file in an IDE such as PyCharm, or you can run it in the terminal using "python3" followed by the name of the py file. If you are going to run in Google Colab, make sure that you upload the necessary datasets first so that it can successfully read the files.

Overall, the project1 file contains all of the code for the three experiments I ran. It starts by importing all of the libraries and then moves on to loading in each of the datasets. Next I merge the three datasets into one combined set and then I save this file to my computer. After this, I start experiment 1 which creates a frequency table and bar graph of the 25 most common words as well as a word cloud from the combined dataset. Up next is experiment 2, which displays histograms for the length of words within each dataset and then finds the mean of the top 25 entries in each dataset. Finally, the file ends with experiment 3 which trims the dataset by getting rid of words with length less than 6. It then checks how many words were eliminated and creates a new bar graph of what are now the top 25 words. The mergeData file contains the code I used to create the combined dataset (merged the frequencies of all three smaller datasets), which I used to then download the combined dataset and then simply import back into the other file as its own pandas data frame. This was done to prevent error messages about not having access to DataFrame methods due to previously using the groupby() method on my dataset. Finally, in addition to the ipynb and py files, I will also include my final report and the 4 csv files that I used as my data sources - wordFrequency.csv, google-books-common-words.csv, kaggle_freq.csv, and combinedWordFrequencies.csv.
