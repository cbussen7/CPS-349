Data Science

This repository contains the assignments and final project I completed in my data science course. The course involved topics such as classification, AI, and ML in Python and much of the code was created in Python notebooks (Google Colab).

My final project deals with a massive Kaggle dataset for identifying credit card fraud. I used this dataset and created several different classifiers and then calculated which classifier worked best.
